# Simple Calculator

## Overview

This is a basic calculator application built using Windows Forms (WinForms) in C#. The calculator allows users to perform standard arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. It has a simple graphical user interface (GUI) and provides easy-to-use functionality.

## Features

- **Basic Arithmetic Operations**: Supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- **Clear Function**: Allows users to reset the input fields and start a new calculation.
- **Decimal Support**: Handles decimal numbers for accurate calculations.
- **Error Handling**: Displays an error message if the user attempts to divide by zero.

## How to Use

1. **Launch the Application**: Start the executable file to open the calculator window.
2. **Input Numbers**: Use the buttons on the form
3. **Select Operation**: Choose an operation (addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division) by clicking the respective operator button.
4. **Get Result**: After entering the numbers and selecting an operation, click the `=` button to view the result.
5. **Clear**: Press the `C` button to clear the current calculation and start a new one.

## Requirements

- **.NET Framework**: Ensure that you have the required version of the .NET Framework installed to run WinForms applications.
- **Operating System**: The calculator runs on Windows operating systems.

## Installation

1. Clone or download the repository.
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Devamirbeghoul/Calculator
   ```
2. Open the project in Visual Studio.
3. Build the solution to compile the application.
4. Run the application in Visual Studio or use the compiled executable file.

## Future Improvements

- Adding more advanced operations such as square roots, exponentiation, etc.
- Supporting keyboard input for all operations.
- Enhancing the user interface design for better user experience.
